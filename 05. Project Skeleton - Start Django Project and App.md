## 5 — Project Skeleton: Start Django Project and App

**Goal:** Create the foundational Django structure — a new Django project and its first app — to begin building the Helpdesk system.

By the end of this lesson, you’ll have a working Django project that runs on your local server.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Ensure Your Virtual Environment Is Active

Before creating the project, make sure your **virtual environment (venv)** is activated.
If not, activate it now:

**For Windows:**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**For macOS/Linux:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(venv)` before your terminal prompt:

```
(venv) C:\Users\You\helpdesk_project>
```

💡 *Always activate your virtual environment before running Django commands.*

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Create a New Django Project

Inside your project folder (`helpdesk_project/`), run:

```bash
django-admin startproject config .
```

This command creates a new Django project named **config** (short for configuration).
The `.` at the end tells Django to create the files *in the current directory* rather than a new subfolder.

✅ After running this, your folder structure should look like this:

```
helpdesk_project/
│
├── config/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
│
├── manage.py
├── venv/
└── requirements.txt
```

**Explanation:**

* `manage.py` — Command-line tool to interact with Django.
* `config/` — Core settings and routing for your project.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Run the Development Server (First Time)

Test your setup by running the Django server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

✅ Expected output:

```
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

Now open your browser and visit:

👉 **[http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)**

You should see the default Django welcome page:

> “The install worked successfully! Congratulations!”

🎉 *You have successfully created and run your first Django project.*

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Create the Helpdesk App

Now create your first Django app named `helpdesk`.
This app will contain the models, views, templates, and URLs for ticket management.

Run this command:

```bash
python manage.py startapp helpdesk
```

✅ Folder structure now becomes:

```
helpdesk_project/
│
├── config/
├── helpdesk/
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── tests.py
│   ├── views.py
│   ├── migrations/
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   └── __init__.py
│
├── manage.py
└── requirements.txt
```

**What each file does:**

* `models.py` → Database structure (Ticket, UserProfile, etc.)
* `views.py` → Business logic and response handling
* `admin.py` → Register models for Django Admin
* `apps.py` → App configuration
* `migrations/` → Database migration files

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Register the App in `settings.py`

Now you must tell Django that your new app exists.

Open **`config/settings.py`**, find the `INSTALLED_APPS` list, and add `'helpdesk',` like this:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    
    # Our app
    'helpdesk',
]
```

Save the file.
Now your Helpdesk app is officially part of the project.
