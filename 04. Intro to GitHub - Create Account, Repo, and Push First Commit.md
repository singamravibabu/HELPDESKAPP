## 4 — Intro to GitHub: Create Account, Repo, and Push First Commit

**Goal:** Connect your local Git project to GitHub, so you can back up code online, collaborate with others, and prepare for CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions later.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (if you don’t have one)

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **Sign up**.
3. Enter:

   * **Username:** choose something professional (e.g., *ravi-dev*).
   * **Email:** use the same one configured in Git earlier.
   * **Password:** secure and memorable.
4. Verify your email address through GitHub’s confirmation link.

✅ Once done, you’ll be redirected to your new GitHub dashboard.
💡 *Tip:* Keep your profile public — it will act as your developer portfolio.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. On the GitHub homepage, click **“+” → New repository**.
2. Fill in the details:

   * **Repository name:** `helpdesk_project`
   * **Description:** `A beginner-friendly Helpdesk system built using Python & Django.`
   * **Public** (recommended for learning)
   * **Do NOT initialize with a README or .gitignore** (we already have these locally)
3. Click **Create repository**.

✅ You’ll now see a page showing “Quick setup” instructions — including the remote URL of your repo.

Example remote URL (HTTPS version):

```
https://github.com/<your-username>/helpdesk_project.git
```

Keep this page open; you’ll need the URL in the next step.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Link Your Local Repository to GitHub

In your **terminal**, make sure you’re inside your local project folder:

```bash
cd helpdesk_project
```

Then connect the local Git repo to GitHub using the **remote add** command:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/helpdesk_project.git
```

Verify the connection:

```bash
git remote -v
```

✅ Expected output:

```
origin  https://github.com/<your-username>/helpdesk_project.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/<your-username>/helpdesk_project.git (push)
```

Now your local project knows where to send and receive code updates.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Push Your First Commit to GitHub

Now, let’s send (push) your first commit from your local repo to GitHub.

Run these commands:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

You may be prompted to **log in with GitHub credentials** (if not already authenticated).
If you use **GitHub CLI** or a **personal access token**, follow the prompts once — Git will remember your authentication.

✅ Output example:

```
Enumerating objects: 12, done.
Counting objects: 100% (12/12), done.
Writing objects: 100% (12/12), 1.50 KiB | 1.50 MiB/s, done.
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

Now visit your GitHub repository in your browser.
You should see your project files and your first commit message:

> “Initial commit: setup virtual environment and project folder”

🎉 Congratulations! Your project is now safely hosted online.

### 🔹 Step 5: Syncing and Collaborating Basics

Let’s cover basic Git commands for daily use when collaborating later:

| Action         | Command                                | Description                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Check changes  | `git status`                           | Shows modified or new files  |
| Stage changes  | `git add .`                            | Adds all changes for commit  |
| Commit changes | `git commit -m "describe your change"` | Saves a new version locally  |
| Pull updates   | `git pull origin main`                 | Fetches updates from GitHub  |
| Push updates   | `git push origin main`                 | Sends your commits to GitHub |
| View log       | `git log --oneline`                    | Shows commit history         |

💡 *Best Practice:* Always `git pull` before making changes to stay up-to-date with others’ commits.
