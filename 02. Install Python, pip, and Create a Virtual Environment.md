## 2 — Install Python, pip, and Create a Virtual Environment

**Goal:** Set up your local development environment for the Helpdesk project. You’ll install Python, pip, and create a clean virtual environment — the foundation for your Django app.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Verify if Python is Already Installed

Before installing, check if Python is already on your system.

**For Windows / macOS / Linux:**

```bash
python --version
```

or

```bash
python3 --version
```

✅ **Expected Output (Example):**

```
Python 3.12.1
```

If you don’t see a version number or it says *command not found*, install Python.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Install Python (If Needed)

1. Go to the official site: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Download the latest **Python 3.x** version for your OS.

3. During installation on **Windows**, make sure to check:

   * ✅ “Add Python to PATH”
   * ✅ “Install pip”

4. Once installed, verify again:

   ```bash
   python --version
   pip --version
   ```

✅ You should now have both Python and pip available globally.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Create a Project Folder and Navigate to It

Create a main project directory to organize your files neatly.

**Commands:**

```bash
mkdir helpdesk_project
cd helpdesk_project
```

This folder will contain:

* Virtual environment (`venv/`)
* Django project files
* Git repository (later)
* README and configuration files

✅ You’re now inside your main project workspace.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

A **virtual environment** isolates dependencies so that your project’s libraries don’t conflict with others.

**Create a virtual environment:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**Activate it:**

* **Windows:**

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
* **macOS/Linux:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

✅ When activated, your terminal prompt will show something like:

```
(venv) C:\Users\You\helpdesk_project>
```

💡 *Pro Tip:* Always activate your virtual environment before running Python or Django commands.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Test the Environment and Install Django

Now that your environment is active, test that pip works and install Django.

**Commands:**

```bash
pip install django
```

Then verify installation:

```bash
python -m django --version
```

✅ Example output:

```
5.0.4
```

**Create a `requirements.txt` file** (this helps team members install dependencies easily later):

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
