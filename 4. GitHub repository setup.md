Make your repo “team-ready”: name, initial files, license, contribution guidelines, and PR/issue templates. You’ll be able to paste these directly into your GitHub repo.

---

# 1) Repository naming convention

* Repo name: `helpdesk-app`

  * Lowercase, hyphen-separated.
  * Short and descriptive.
  * Will be used in Docker image tags (`helpdesk-app:latest`) and GitHub Actions references.

---

# 2) Create repository on GitHub

* Organization or personal account → click **New Repository**.
* Name: `helpdesk-app`
* Description: `HelpDesk Application built with Django, DRF, Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL, Celery, and FullCalendar.`
* Visibility: choose **Private** (for internal dev) or **Public** (if open-source).
* **Do NOT** initialize with README/License/Gitignore here — we’ll add our own.

# 3) Initial local setup commands

On your local machine:

```bash
# clone empty repo
git clone git@github.com:your-org/helpdesk-app.git

# 4) README.md (starter version)

Create `README.md` in project root:
