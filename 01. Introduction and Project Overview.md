## 1 — Introduction & Project Overview

### *Project: Helpdesk System using Python & Django*

**Goal:** Understand what you’ll build, why it matters, and how the course will progress.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Understand the Purpose of the Helpdesk Project

The **Helpdesk System** is a small web-based application that allows:

* Users (customers or employees) to **submit support tickets** for issues.
* Staff (support agents or admins) to **manage, assign, and resolve** those tickets.
* Communication through **comments** and **status updates** on each ticket.

**Real-world use cases:**

* IT support ticketing system.
* Customer service helpdesk.
* Internal bug/issue tracker for small teams.

The project is **simple enough for beginners**, yet **realistic enough** to teach software collaboration and CI/CD workflows.

### 🔹 Step 2: Define the Project Features

You’ll build these **core features** step-by-step over 50 lessons:

**User Features:**

* Register, log in, and log out.
* Create, view, and edit support tickets.
* Add attachments (optional).
* Comment on ticket updates.

**Staff Features:**

* View all tickets and assign them to users.
* Change ticket statuses (Open, In Progress, Closed).
* Add comments and manage resolution notes.

**Common Features:**

* Notifications and activity log.
* Simple search and filter options.
* Basic email notifications (via Django console backend).
* Admin interface customization.
* REST API (minimal, later lessons).

### 🔹 Step 3: Tech Stack Overview

We’ll use the following **technologies and tools**:

| Category             | Tool                           | Purpose                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Programming Language | **Python 3.x**                 | Core development                   |
| Web Framework        | **Django 5.x (latest stable)** | Web backend and MVC                |
| Database             | **SQLite (default Django DB)** | Lightweight, file-based database   |
| Frontend             | **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap**       | Basic UI styling                   |
| Version Control      | **Git**                        | Track and manage changes           |
| Remote Repo          | **GitHub**                     | Collaboration & CI/CD              |
| Automation           | **GitHub Actions**             | Continuous Integration and Testing |
| Code Editor          | **VS Code (recommended)**      | Coding and Git integration         |

💡 *Note:* You don’t need Docker, Redis, or advanced tools. Everything runs locally and integrates easily with GitHub.

### 🔹 Step 5: Project Deliverables

By the end of Lesson 50, you’ll have:

1. ✅ A **fully functional Django Helpdesk system** running locally.
2. ✅ A **GitHub repository** with a clean commit history and branches.
3. ✅ **Automated CI/CD** via GitHub Actions (running tests and linting).
4. ✅ A **README.md** documenting the project setup and usage.
5. ✅ Experience in real-world team workflow — like junior developers in startups.
